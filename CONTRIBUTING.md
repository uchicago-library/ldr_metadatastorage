# Contribution Principles

## Summary 

We welcome all contributions the metadata storage system repository. We value making an inclusive and respectful place to have discussions about feature requests,
file bug reports and dialog about design decisions. If you want to contribute code, you should

- clone the repository
- make a new branch named something descriptive that reflects the change you are positing
- submit a pull request with a brief explanation of why you think this change needs to be made and how you believe that your change is the best approach

After that, the whole team will review your changes and begin a discussion in the Pull Request. We insist on respectful and inclusive dialog and language during the entirety of this discussion. 
Anyone who violates tihs principle will be pulled aside for separate discussion. We encourage you to participate in this discussion. 

This discussion will last approximately one full work from the day that you submit the pull request. If you sumit on Wednesday, the discussion will occur the following week
from Monday-Friday. On Friday, if all parties have agreed that your changes truly are the best solution to the problem and appropriate for the project and there are no changes that need to be made the pull request will be accepted.

If there are changes that need to be made, the pull request will be rejected and you should make the recommended changes and submit a new pull request. A second pull request will not require the full week of discussion, only enough time for everyone on the governing group to review the changes and approve them. Once the whole governing group has approved the changes, the pull request will be accepted.
