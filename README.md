## Introduction

Metadata storage must be able to answer the following questions about an intellectual unit.

1. What collection(s) does this unit belong to? This is the primary intellectual access point.
1. What is the title of this unit? This is a secondary access point.
1. What is the publication date of this unit? This is a secondary acess point.
1. Who is the creator of this unit? This a secondary access point.
1. Where can I find a representation of this unit? This is the primary access point.

We have to assume that there will be AT LEAST two types of metadata in the ldr metadata storage system.

1. Metadata about units that belong to the University of Chicago Library and which all assets associated are in asset storage, e.g. OwnCloud
1. Metadata about Units that do not belong to the University of Chicago Library and which assets are stored elsewhere, e.g. Luna

This means that in order to provide a REQUIRED functionality, ldr metadata storage must be able to retrieve assets from either asset storage or any arbitrary outside storage accessible over the Web. It is therefore MANDATORY that all publicly available assets be available over the Web. However, the system must be able to distinguish between a remote asset and a library-controlled asset in order to know where to point clients for the location of assets. In order to distinguish between the two types of assets, there must be some marker for the ldr metadata storage to use to make this distinction. One marker will lead the ldr metadata storage to locate the assets from the digcoll retriever. The other will tell it to check if the address is valid. If the address is not valid, the ldr metadata storage should notify the administrators of the ldr metadata storage as well as the person attempting to ingest material into the ldr metadata storage. Any identifier that points to an asset controlled by the library MIST be a URI, because the ldr metadata storage must know from what host to pull the assets and we must assume that this host will change over time. Any identifier that points to a remote asset must be a URL. This is how the system will be able to distinguish what is a library-controlled asset and remote asset.

We also have to assume that there will be a variety of descriptive metadata formats used. These are the metadata formats currently being used in library digital collections.

- TEI
- EAD
- MODS
- VRACore
- OCR
- MARC

This means that the metadata storage must be able to store a variety of metadata formats that are not actionable by the metadata storage. However, the metadata storage must have a single schema that it can interpret in order to provide answers to the five questions defined earlier in this document.

COROLLARY: the metadata storage should be able to store technical metadata about assets in digital collections. Technical metadata is currently being stored in asset storage, but there is a strong argument to be made that doing this "muddies the water" between asset and metadata. Asset ought to be strictly defined as a byte stream representing an intellectual unit or some portion of an intellectual unit. By storing technical metadata, which by definition is not a byte stream representing a whole or some port of an intellectual unit but rather information about the byte stream the asset storage is being forced to perform a task that is a violation of its primary function.

## Contract for available endpoints

1. / = returns the endpoints available at the root of the API
1. /units = returns a list of intellectual units (collections) in the ldr metadata storage
1. /units/[collection identifier/sub collection identifier/ sub-sub collection identifier] = returns a list of intellectual units that are part of a particular collection [sub-collection, etc.]
1. /unit/[collection identifier] = returns the endpoints available for a particular intellectual unit
1. /unit/[intellectual unit identifier]/core = returns the core (metadata) describing a particular intellectual unit
1. /unit/[intellectual unit identifier]/extensions = returns a list of extension identifiers that are available for a particular intellectual unit
1. /unit/[intellectual unit identifier]/extensions/[extension identifier] = returns the extension metadata identified by the extension identifier that is available for a particular intellectual unit

## Contract for GET request responses from the ldr metadata storage

Every valid GET request to the ldr metadata is GUARANTEED to receive a well-formed XML or JSON response. This XML or JSON response will have the following information

- the request that the ldr metadata storage received
- the date and time in ISO-8601 that the ldr metadata storage received that request WILL be the request timestamp from the timezone of the requestor
- the date and time in ISO-8601 that the ldr metadata storage sent the response from the timezone of the ldr metadata storage
- the type of response returned WILL be either aggregate or atomic
- the response in the form of the answer to the question asked by the request
- the response will be items if the response type is aggregate
- the response will be either metadata or extension if the response type is atomic
- items will contain an item for each result that is part of the answer to the question being asked
- the value of an item WILL ALWAYS be a URI resolvable by the ldr metadata storage
- metadata will contain dublin core metadata
- metadata will have an implicit namespace
  - ```http://lib.uchicago.edu/ldr```
- metadata will have 3 explicit namespaces
  - ```http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance```
  - ```http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/```
  - ```http://purl.org/dc/terms/```
- metadata WILL contain a dc:title
- metadata MAY contain a dc:date
- metadata MAY contain a dc:relation
- metadata WILL contain AT LEAST one dc:identifier
- dc:identifier WILL have an attribute xsi:type
- the attribute xsi:type on dc:identifier WILL either have have dcterms:URI OR dcterms:URL

## Glossary

- intellectual unit is a collection of intellectual units or a collection of assets
- unit is an abbreviation of intellectual unit
- asset is a byte stream representing an intellectual unit whether in-whole or in-part
- descriptive metadata represents one description of an intellectual unit
- metadata is an abbreviation of descriptive metadata
- endpoint is a particular context for metadata that will provide some functionality
- functionality is either a.) the answer to a particular question about a particular resource or b.) some action or set of actions that transforms the resource identified into something new for the client to consume
- field is a particular part of metadata. ex. title is a field
- core metadata (abbreviated "core") are the REQUIRED fields: a.) 1 title, b.) 1 creator, c.) 1 date, d.) 1 or more identifier fields, e.) 1 or more relation fields
- extension metadata (abbreviated "extension" or "extensions") are OPTIONAL descriptive metadata for an intellectual unit
- client is a program that is requesting metadata. A client may be acting on behalf of a biological being.
- technical metadata is technical information about an asset. This information may include but is not limited to width and height pixel dimensions of an image byte stream or duration of a video file or size in disk storage required by a particular byte stream.
