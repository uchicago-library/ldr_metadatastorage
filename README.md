## Glossary of terms

- intellectual unit is a set of assets that comprise a complete work (whether a piece of art, a photograph, a book, or some other output) created by an individual or group of individuals. They can be discovered by defined access points in descriptive metadata. This is business logic and a term that is only truly meaningful to the human producers and human consumers of the content and as such defining a concrete rule set for intellectual unit generation is out-of-scope of the ldr metadata storage.
- unit is an abbreviation of intellectual unit
- asset is a byte stream representing an intellectual unit whether in-whole or in-part
- (metadata) resource is a representation of description about an intellectual unit
- endpoint is a particular context available to a (metadata) resource that will provide some functionality
- functionality is either a.) the answer to a particular question about a particular resource or b.) some action or set of actions that transforms the resource identified into something new for the client to consume
- field is a particular piece of metadata. ex. title is a field
- core (metadata) is the REQUIRED descriptive fields: a.) 1 title field, b.) 1 creator field, c.) 1 date field, d.) 1 or more identifier fields, e.) 1 or more relation fields
- extension (metadata) is an OPTIONAL descriptive metadata resource for an intellectual unit
- client is a a program running on a server that is requesting a resource. This client may be acting on behalf of a biological being.
- collection  is a group of intellectual units typically related as part of a work unit commissioned by the library or by some intellectual relationship between the units
- technical_metadata is information about the assets that represent a particular intellectual unit. This information may include but is not limited to width and height pixel dimensions of an image byte stream or duration of a video file or size in disk storage required by a particular byte stream.

## Requirements for the metadata storage system

Metadata storage must be able to answer the following questions about an intellectual unit

1. What is the collection that this unit belongs to use as the main access point for the user
1. what is the title of this unit to display as the second access point for the user
1. what is the publication date of this unit to use as third acess point for the user
1. Who is the creator of this unit to use as the fourth access point for the user 5. What is the identifier for this resource to be able to locate the assets associated with this unit in order to display them to the user
1. What is the identifier of the asset whether library-controlled or remote so that the ldr metadata storage can point the user to the asset or assets that are part of this unit

There are two types of metadata that will be in the ldr metadata storage system.

1. units that belong to the University of Chicago library and which all assets associated are in asset storage
1. units that do not belong to the University of Chicago library and which assets are stored elsewhere

This means that in order to provide a REQUIRED functionality, ldr metadata storage must be able to retrieve assets from either asset storage or any arbitrary outside storage accessible. It is therefore MANDATORY that all assets be available over the public Web.

This also means the ldr metadata storage must be able to distinguish between a remote asset and a library-controlled asset.

In order to distinguish between the two types of assets, there must be some marker for the ldr metadata storage to use to make this distinction. One marker will lead the ldr metadata storage to locate the assets from the digcoll retriever. The other will tell it to check if the address is valid. If the address is not valid, the ldr metadata storage should notify the administrators of the ldr metadata storage as well as the person attempting to ingest material into the ldr metadata storage.

The asset storage identifier should be a URI, because the ldr metadata storage must know from what host to pull the assets and we must assume that this host will change over time.

The remote storage identifier must be a valid URL to the location of the asset on the web.

We have to assume that there will be a variety of descriptive metadata formats used. Since there are five known metadata formats currently being used in library digital collections.

- TEI
- EAD
- MODS
- VRACore
- OCR

This means that the metadata storage must be able to store a variety of metadata formats that are not actionable by the metadata storage. The metadata storage must have a single schema that it can interpret in order to provide the five functions defined at the beginning of this document.

COROLLARY: the metadata storage should be able to store technical metadata about assets in digital collections. This technical metadata is currently being stored in asset storage, but there is a strong argument to be made that doing this "muddies the water" between asset and metadata. Asset ought to be strictly defined as a byte stream representing an intellectual unit or some portion of an intellectual unit. By storing technical metadata, which by definition is not a byte stream representing a whole or some port of an intellectual unit but rather information about the byte stream the asset storage is being forced to perform a task that is a violation of its primary function.

## Contract for available endpoints

1. /units/[intellectual unit identifier]/extensions/[extension identifier] = returns the extension (metadata) identified by extension identifier that is available for intellectual unit unit identifier

## Contract for GET request responses from the ldr metadata storage

Every valid GET request to the ldr metadata is GUARANTEED to receive a well-formed XML response. This XML response will have the following information

- the request that the ldr metadata storage received
- the date and time in ISO-8601 that the ldr metadata storage received that request WILL be the request timestamp from the timezone of the requestor
- the date and time in ISO-8601 that the ldr metadata storage sent the response from the timezone of the ldr metadata storage
- the type of response returned WILL be either aggregate or atomic
- the response in the form of the answer to the question asked by the request
- the response will be items if the response type is aggregate
- the response will be either metadata or extension if the response type is atomic
- items will contain an item for each result that is part of the answer to the question being asked
- the value of an item WILL ALWAYS be a uri complete-able by the ldr metadata storage
- metadata will contain dublin core metadata
- metadata will have an implicit namespace
  - ```http://example.org/myapp/```
- metadata will have 3 explicit namespaces
  - ```http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance```
  - ```http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/```
  - ```http://purl.org/dc/terms/```
- metadata WILL contain a dc:title
